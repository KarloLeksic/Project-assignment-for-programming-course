# Project-assignment-for-programming-course

My first major project in C!
Programming 2, FERIT, 2nd semester.

This is a repost from my GitLab account to keep everything in one place, here on GitHub. [Here](https://gitlab.com/lekxka/projektni-zadatak-programiranje-2) is the original repo.

It is a small "application" in the C programming language on the topic of a warehouse of a web shop with electronic products.
